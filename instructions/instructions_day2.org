* Review
  - You must decide which job offers to accept.
  - You must decide which of your current jobs to work on.
  - You are paid for completed jobs, and penalized for ones you fail to complete.
  - Some jobs will be better than others, so you will have to decide whether an offered job is worth accepting.
* Second Day
  - Payments today will be more sensitive to your performance
  - Each period, you lose 18 cents (think of this as costs to keep the business running).
  - But, we will multiply your final earnings by 4x.
  - This table shows how much you will make if you make the same decisions as you did in Day 1.
| Day 1 Earnings | After losses | Day 2 Earnings |
|----------------+--------------+----------------|
| $19            | $1           | $4             |
| $24            | $6           | $24            |
| $29            | $11          | $44            |
