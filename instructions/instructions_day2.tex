\label{sec:orgbd03e27}
\begin{itemize}
\item You must decide which job offers to accept.
\item You must decide which of your current jobs to work on.
\item You are paid for completed jobs, and penalized for ones you fail to complete.
\item Some jobs will be better than others, so you will have to decide whether an offered job is worth accepting.
\end{itemize}
\section*{Second Day}
\label{sec:orge8559f7}
